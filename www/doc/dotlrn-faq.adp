The dotLRN software relies on <a        href=http://openacs.org>OpenACS v4.5</a> and includes data model,        application logic, and templates to get you up and running very        quickly.        <p class="question">Q: Is dotLRN usable?    <p class="answer">        dotLRN is currently in <strong>alpha</strong> state. The        target audience at this time is mostly early        adopters. <strong>No backwards-compatibility will be ensured        until a beta version</strong>. That said, dotLRN is quite        stable as is and can most certainly be used to determine        near-term usability in a production environment.        <p class="question">Q: When will dotLRN ship?    <p class="answer">        dotLRN beta is planned for May 1st, 2002. dotLRN v1.0 is        planned for August 1st, 2002.        <p class="question">Q: How can I contribute?    <p class="answer">        We are currently developing our contribution mechanisms.        <p class="answer">If you are actively interested in helping us        develop these mechanisms, please contact us at <a        href=mailto:dotlrn@openforce.net>dotlrn@openforce.net</a>.        <p class="question">Q: What about this dotLRN Governance discussion?    <p class="answer">        The discussion is still under way. MIT Sloan will be providing        the framework for this in the very near future.    <p class="heading"><a class="plain" name="development">State of dotLRN     Development</a>      <p class="question">Q: So what version of OpenACS do I need to use?     <p class="answer">    dotLRN will work with OpenACS v4.5. Currently, dotLRN requires    some fixes to OpenACS that are not part of beta1 (but which will be    part of a later beta), so you'll need to download the latest OpenACS    CVS.    <p class="answer"> When dotLRN is released as a complete tarball,    we will specify exactly which OpenACS tarball you'll need to use.    <p class="question">Q: Wait, why isn't it compatible with PostgreSQL?       <p class="answer">    We have focused our initial development on Oracle compatibility    for MIT Sloan. We have made significant headway in PostgreSQL    compatibility, and we (OpenForce) intend to use dotLRN on    PostgreSQL. Full PostgreSQL support is imminent, and all progress will    immediately appear in the CVS tree.        <p class="question">Q: Can I use ACS Classic 4.2/4.3?     <p class="answer">    You can try, but we haven't done any testing with ACS Classic, nor do    we intend to. We suspect that the numerous improvements made to    OpenACS over the past few months will make dotLRN <b>incompatible</b>    with ACS Classic.        <p class=heading><a class=plain name=openforce>    The OpenForce Role in dotLRN</a>      <p class="question">    Q: What's the relationship between MIT Sloan and OpenForce?     <p class="answer">        MIT Sloan hired OpenForce to develop dotLRN to replace the aging    SloanSpace v1, which itself was built on ACS v3.      <p class="question">Q: How will OpenForce work with other OpenACS    developers?     <p class="answer">    OpenForce will continually provide anonymous CVS access to the    dotLRN development tree. OpenForce will continue to provide    architectural direction and goals for dotLRN. Over time, OpenForce    will qualify and include new developers in the core development    process. OpenForce expects to lead - but not monopolize - the dotLRN    process. OpenForce will also provide a repository of dotLRN    applications available for all to obtain existing dotLRN extensions    and provide new ones to the community.      <p class="question">Q: Will OpenForce develop, support, and/or host    dotLRN commercially?     <p class="answer"> Absolutely.    <p class="question">Q: Will OpenForce preclude me from providing    my own services surrounding dotLRN?     <p class="answer"> Absolutely not.    <p class="question">Q: But Why? Aren't you crazy to throw away    such clear business opportunity?     <p class="answer">     We are not in the business of selling packaged closed-source    software. We believe that open-source software and a strong    developer community provides plenty of opportunity for numerous    commercial services. We intend to stick to the Open-Source track    100%. No tricks here.      <p class=heading><a class=plain name=openacs>dotLRN and OpenACS</a>      <p class="question">Q: Is dotLRN a part of the OpenACS project?     <p class="answer">        dotLRN is not part of the OpenACS project, but it is an OpenACS    application. This means that dotLRN will install on a vanilla    OpenACS without additional modifications and through the regular,    accepted OpenACS API. While dotLRN developers happen to also be    core OpenACS developers, the dotLRN team is taking all possible    measures to ensure that any modification suggested to the OpenACS    core is approved by other OpenACS developers that do not have a    direct stake in dotLRN.      <p class="question">Q: Will dotLRN be merged into OpenACS?     <p class="answer">    This is a question to be answered by the OpenACS community.      <p class=heading><a class=plain name=licensing>Licensing</a>    <p class="question">Q: What are the terms of use for dotLRN?     <p class="answer">    dotLRN is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2.    <p class=heading><a class=plain name=misc>Miscellaneous</a>        <p class="question">Q: How is dotLRN spelled and pronounced?    <p class="answer">    It's sometimes written as <tt>.LRN</tt>, but the spelling and    capitalization <tt>dotLRN</tt> is preferred. <tt>dotLRN</tt> is    pronounced &quot;daught-learn&quot; We are currently accepting    voice applications for the dotLRN MP3 pronounciation file.</div><%= [dotlrn_footer] %>
