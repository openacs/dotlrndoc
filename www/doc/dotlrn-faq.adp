The dotLRN software relies on <a href=http://openacs.org>OpenACS v4</a> and includes data model, application logic, and templates to get you up and running very quickly.    <P>Read more at <a href=http://dotLRN.mit.edu>dotLRN.mit.edu</a>    </div>              <div class=question>Q: Is dotLRN usable?</div>    <div class=answer>    dotLRN is currently in alpha state. The target audience at this time is mostly early adopters. Note also that no backwards-compatibility will be ensured until a beta version. That said, dotLRN is quite stable as is and can most certainly be used to determine near-term usability in a production environment.    </div>        <div class=question>Q: When will dotLRN ship?</div>    <div class=answer>    dotLRN beta is planned for May 1st, 2002. dotLRN v1.0 is planned for August 1st, 2002.    </div>        <div class=question>Q: How can I contribute?</div>    <div class=answer>    We are currently developing our contribution mechanisms. If you would like to work on the core, you should email <a mailto:dotlrn-core@openforce.biz>dotlrn-core@openforce.biz</a>. If you would like to build new dotLRN extensions, you can check out <a href=>how to build dotLRN extensions</a>.    </div>      <!-- end Basics -->    <div class=heading><P><a name=openforce>The OpenForce Role in dotLRN</a></div>      <div class=question>Q: What's the relationship between Sloan and OpenForce?</div>     <div class=answer>A: Sloan hired OpenForce to develop dotLRN to replace the aging SloanSpace v1.</div>            <div class=question>Q: How will OpenForce work with other OpenACS    developers?</div>     <div class=answer>A: OpenForce will continually provide anonymous CVS access to the dotLRNdevelopment tree. OpenForce will continue to provide architecturaldirection and goals for dotLRN. Over time, OpenForce will qualify andinclude new developers in the core development process. OpenForceexpects to lead - but not monopolize - the dotLRN process. OpenForcewill also provide a repository of dotLRN applications available forall to obtain existing dotLRN extensions and provide new ones to the community.    </div>            <div class=question>Q: Will OpenForce develop, support, and/or host    dotLRN commercially?</div>     <div class=answer>A: Absolutely.</div>    <div class=question>Q: Will OpenForce preclude me from providingmy own services surrounding dotLRN?</div>     <div class=answer>A: Absolutely not.</div>    <div class=question>Q: But Why? Aren't you crazy to throw awaysuch clear business opportunity?</div>     <div class=answer>A: We are not in the business of sellingpackaged closed-source software. We believe that open-source softwareand a strong developer community provides plenty of opportunity fornumerous commercial services. We intend to stick to the Open-Sourcetrack 100%. No tricks here.</div>    <!-- end OpenForce -->    <div class=heading><P><a name=openacs>dotLRN and OpenACS</a></div>      <div class=question>Q: Is dotLRN a part of the OpenACS project?</div>     <div class=answer>dotLRN is not part of the OpenACS project, butis an OpenACS application. This means that dotLRN will install on avanilla OpenACS without additional modifications and through theregular, accepted OpenACS API. While dotLRN developers happen to alsobe core OpenACS developers, the dotLRN team is taking all possiblemeasures to ensure that any modification suggested to the OpenACS coreis approved by other OpenACS developers that do not have a directstake in dotLRN.</div>           <div class=question>Q: Will dotLRN be merged into OpenACS?</div>     <div class=answer>A: This is a question to be answered by the OpenACScommunity.</div>        <!-- end OpenACS -->    <div class=heading><P><a name=licensing>Licensing</a></div>  <!-- end Licensing -->    <div class=question>Q: What are the terms of use for dotLRN?</div>     <div class=answer>A: dotLRN is distributed under the GNU GeneralPublic License v2. </div>  <div class=heading><P><a name=misc>Miscellaneous</a></div>        <div class=question>Q: How is dotLRN spelled and pronounced?</div>    <div class=answer>A: It's sometimes written as <tt>.LRN</tt>, but    the spelling and capitalization <tt>dotLRN</tt> is    preferred. <tt>dotLRN</tt> is pronounced &quot;daught-learn&quot; We are currently accepting voice applications for the dotLRN MP3 pronounciation file.    </div>      <!-- end misc --></div><!-- end q and a --><!-- End Body --><!-- Begin Footer --><CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="100%" BORDER="0" CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0">	<TR>		<TD COLSPAN="2"><IMG SRC="/images/blank.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="25" ALT="" BORDER=0></TD>	</TR>        <TR>                <TD COLSPAN="2" BGCOLOR="#000000"><IMG SRC="/images/blank.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="1" ALT="" BORDER=0></TD>        </TR>        <TR>                <TD COLSPAN="2"><IMG SRC="/images/blank.gif" WIDTH="1" HEIGHT="5" ALT="" BORDER=0></TD>        </TR>	<TR>		<TD ALIGN="left" VALIGN="top"><DIV CLASS="footer"><A HREF="contact.adp">Contact OpenForce</A>		</DIV></TD>		<TD ALIGN="right"><DIV CLASS="footer"><A HREF="#top">return to top 		<IMG SRC="/images/up.gif" BORDER="0"></A><BR>		&copy; 2002 OpenForce, Inc.</DIV></TD>	</TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-- End Footer --></BODY></HTML>
