All users can see the description of the class in general. Users who
are registered for a particular instance of that class see links to
those term offerings.

- Per-Class Admin Page

The sitewide admins can access this section which allows:
    - creation of new instances of this class
    - assignment of profs and tas to each instance of a class
    - editing the main blurb about each class

- Per-Class-Instance Main Page

Users not registered for this instance of this class see only an
informational page about the class, including the public files like
the syllabus.

Users registered for this instance of this class see their full portal data.

Profs, TAs, and admins for this class instance can see the admin section
for a class. This admin section allows management of class membership.

packages.
